#### Summary:
In this final project for MATH 4570, Matrix Methods in Data Analysis 
and Machine Learning at Northeastern University (Spring 2022), five students
trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification of brain hemorrhages
(TensorFlow, Keras, PIL). 
After remarkable success (>95% prediction accuracy), we pivot to evaluating the performance of 
seven CNN optimizers, AdaDelta, AdaGrad, Adam, AdaMax, NAdam, RMSprop, and SGD 
(Stochastic Gradient Descent). The final model, using the Adam optimizer, attains a testing accuracy 
score of 98%.
